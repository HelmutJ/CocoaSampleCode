### OpenCL Parallel Prefix Sum (aka Scan) Example ###===========================================================================DESCRIPTION:This example shows how to perform an efficient parallel prefix sum (aka Scan)using OpenCL.  Scan is a common data parallel primitive which can be used forvariety of different operations -- this example uses local memory for storingpartial sums and avoids memory bank conflicts on architectures which serializememory operations that are serviced on the same memory bank by offsetting theloads and stores based on the size of the local group and the number ofmemory banks (see appropriate macro definition).  As a result, this examplerequires that the local group size > 1.Note that the .cl compute kernel file(s) are loaded and compiled atruntime.  The example source assumes that these files are in the same path as the built executable.For simplicity, this example is intended to be run from the command line.If run from within XCode, open the Run Log (Command-Shift-R) to see the output.  Alternatively, run the applications from within a Terminal.app session to launch from the command line.===========================================================================BUILD REQUIREMENTS:Mac OS X v10.6 or later===========================================================================RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS:Mac OS X v10.6 or later with OpenCL 1.0===========================================================================PACKAGING LIST:ReadMe.txtscan.cscan_kernel.clscan.xcodeproj===========================================================================CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS:Version 1.0- First version.===========================================================================Copyright (C) 2008 Apple Inc.
