Fireworks

This application demonstrates the use of Core Animation's particle system. 'Fireworks' uses a single CAEmitterLayer and multiple nested CAEmitterCells to create a fireworks simulation. Some of the properties of the fireworks can be manipulated via the user interface.

FireworksAppDelegate.h/m
Standard app delegate generated by Xcode for a new project.

AppController.h/m
This is the main controller for the application and handles the setup of the layer objects, connecting them up to the view, responding to slider events, and animating the CAEmitterLayer & CAEmitterCell objects. An instance of this class resides in MainMenu.xib and uses an IBOutlet reference for the view and slider (which has been wired up through Interface Builder).

-awakeFromNib
This method will be called when the AppController instance is 'defrosted' from the nib and will setup the layer hierarchy and set the initial vales for the CAEmitterLayer & CAEmitterCell objects.

-(IBAction)slidersMoved:(id)sender
Called when the slider value is changed by the user. The properties of the CAEmitterLayer & CAEmitterCell objects will be animated based on the new slider value to produce a corresponding fire effect.

-(IBAction)resetSliders:(id)sender
Called when the user clicks the 'Reset Sliders' button. The slider positions to the default values.
